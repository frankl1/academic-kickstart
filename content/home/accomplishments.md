  description = "In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach."

  description = "This course starts by teaching the stochastic processes behind any time series. I have learnt to estimate the parameters of such stochastic processes. I have finally learnt time series analysis models MA(q), AR(p), ARMA(p,q), ARIMA(p,q,d), SARIMA(p,q,d,s) and Holt-Winters, and applied them on different datasets using the R programming language"

  description = "A practical introduction to deep learning using tensorflow. In this course, I learnt how do feedforward neural network, convotional neural network and recurrent neural network work. I have also learnt about data augmentation and time series forecasting. I use the Kera api through tensorflow to build all my models"
